# Chapter 2: Plate Tectonics

## Summary Based on Student Learning Outcomes

### 1. Describe how the ideas behind plate tectonics started with Alfred Wegener’s hypothesis of continental drift
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - Alfred Wegener proposed the **continental drift hypothesis** in 1910, suggesting continents were once connected and drifted apart, based on evidence like matching fossils, rocks, and past glaciations across continents.
- 【Example】  
  - Fossils of *Mesosaurus* found in both South America and Africa supported the idea of connected continents.

### 2. Describe the physical and chemical layers of the Earth and how they affect plate movement
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Chemical layers**: Crust (granitic continental and basaltic oceanic), Mantle (peridotite-dominated), and Core (iron-nickel).  
  - **Physical layers**: Lithosphere (rigid plates), Asthenosphere (ductile, enables plate movement), Mesosphere (rigid), Outer Core (liquid, generates magnetic field), Inner Core (solid).
- 【Example】  
  - The **asthenosphere**’s ductile behavior allows lithospheric plates to float and move.

### 3. Explain how movement at the three types of plate boundaries causes earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Convergent boundaries**: Plates collide → subduction or collision → earthquakes, volcanoes, mountains.  
  - **Divergent boundaries**: Plates separate → rift valleys, mid-ocean ridges, volcanism.  
  - **Transform boundaries**: Plates slide past → earthquakes.
- 【Example】  
  - The San Andreas Fault (transform) causes frequent earthquakes without major volcanism.

### 4. Identify convergent boundaries, including subduction and collisions, as places where plates come together
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - At **convergent boundaries**, denser plates (oceanic) subduct beneath less dense plates (continental), or two continental plates collide to form mountain ranges.
- 【Example】  
  - The Himalayas formed from the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates.

### 5. Identify divergent boundaries, including rifts and mid-ocean ridges, as places where plates separate
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Divergent boundaries** involve plates pulling apart, leading to rift valleys on land or mid-ocean ridges under the sea.
- 【Example】  
  - The East African Rift Zone is an active continental rift.

### 6. Explain transform boundaries as places where adjacent plates shear past each other
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Transform boundaries** involve lateral sliding motion between plates, leading mainly to earthquakes.
- 【Example】  
  - The San Andreas Fault is a classic right-lateral (dextral) transform fault.

### 7. Describe the Wilson Cycle, beginning with continental rifting, ocean basin creation, plate subduction, and ending with ocean basin closure
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - The **Wilson Cycle** describes the life cycle of ocean basins: rifting → mid-ocean spreading → subduction → collision → new supercontinent.
- 【Example】  
  - The Atlantic Ocean is currently in a spreading phase; the Pacific is shrinking.

### 8. Explain how the tracks of hotspots, places that have continually rising magma, are used to calculate plate motion
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Hotspots** are fixed magma sources beneath plates; as plates move over them, chains of volcanic islands form, recording plate direction and speed.
- 【Example】  
  - The Hawaiian Islands were formed as the Pacific Plate moved over a stationary hotspot.
