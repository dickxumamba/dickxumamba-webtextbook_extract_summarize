# Chapter 3: Minerals

## Summary Based on Student Learning Outcomes

### 1. Define mineral
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic, solid substance with a regular crystal structure and a defined chemical composition, formed by geological processes.
- 【Example】  
  - Calcite (CaCO3) precipitated from ocean water is a mineral, but biological calcite in a living clam shell is not considered a mineral until it undergoes burial and geological processes.

### 2. Describe the basic structure of the atom
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - Atoms consist of a **nucleus** (protons and neutrons) surrounded by **electrons**.  
  - Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons are neutral.
- 【Example】  
  - A carbon atom has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (in the common isotope), and 6 electrons.

### 3. Derive basic atomic information from the Periodic Table of Elements
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - The **atomic number** represents the number of protons; the **atomic mass** reflects protons + neutrons.  
  - **Isotopes** are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
- 【Example】  
  - Carbon-12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons) and Carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons) are isotopes of carbon.

### 4. Describe chemical bonding related to minerals
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Ionic bonding**: Electron transfer between ions with opposite charges (e.g., NaCl).  
  - **Covalent bonding**: Electron sharing between atoms (e.g., O2 molecule).
- 【Example】  
  - In the mineral halite (NaCl), sodium and chlorine ions form an ionic bond.

### 5. Describe the main ways minerals form
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - Three main formation processes:  
    1. **Precipitation** from aqueous solutions (e.g., tufa from springs)  
    2. **Crystallization** from magma cooling (e.g., basalt crystals)  
    3. **Biological precipitation** by organisms (e.g., shells forming limestone).
- 【Example】  
  - Travertine terraces at Yellowstone form from calcite precipitation.

### 6. Describe the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron and how it forms common silicate minerals
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - A **silicon-oxygen tetrahedron** (SiO4) has a central silicon atom bonded to four oxygen atoms.  
  - Tetrahedra can link in various ways: isolated, chains, sheets, or frameworks, forming different silicate mineral groups.
- 【Example】  
  - Quartz (SiO2) is a framework silicate where all tetrahedra share oxygen atoms.

### 7. List common non-silicate minerals in oxide, sulfide, sulfate, and carbonate groups
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - **Oxides**: Hematite (Fe2O3)  
  - **Sulfides**: Galena (PbS), Pyrite (FeS2)  
  - **Sulfates**: Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O)  
  - **Carbonates**: Calcite (CaCO3)
- 【Example】  
  - The Bonneville Salt Flats are covered with halite (a halide mineral formed by evaporation).

### 8. Identify minerals using physical properties and identification tables
- 【Concept Summary】  
  - Common identification properties include **hardness** (Mohs scale), **luster**, **color**, **streak**, **cleavage**, and **crystal habit**.
- 【Example】  
  - Quartz is harder (Mohs hardness 7) than calcite (Mohs hardness 3), which reacts with dilute acid.

## Important Terms and Definitions
- **Mineral**: A naturally occurring, inorganic, crystalline solid with a defined chemical composition.
- **Atom**: The basic unit of matter, composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
- **Isotope**: Variants of an element with the same number of protons but different neutrons.
- **Ion**: An atom that has lost or gained electrons, resulting in a charge.
- **Ionic bond**: Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.
- **Covalent bond**: Sharing of electrons between atoms.
- **Silicon-oxygen tetrahedron**: Fundamental building block of silicate minerals, consisting of one silicon atom and four oxygen atoms.
- **Precipitation**: Formation of minerals from a solution as it becomes saturated.
- **Mafic minerals**: Dark-colored silicate minerals rich in iron and magnesium (e.g., olivine, pyroxene).
- **Sheet silicates**: Silicates formed by stacked sheets of tetrahedra (e.g., micas, clays).
- **Framework silicates**: Minerals where tetrahedra share all four oxygen atoms (e.g., quartz, feldspar).
- **Carbonates**: Minerals with carbonate ions (CO3-2), like calcite.
- **Oxides**: Minerals with metal ions bonded to oxygen (e.g., hematite).
- **Sulfides**: Minerals with metals bonded to sulfur (e.g., galena).
- **Sulfates**: Minerals containing the sulfate ion (SO4-2) (e.g., gypsum).
- **Mohs hardness scale**: Scale measuring mineral hardness from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond).
